# This workflow provides a required status check that always runs on every PR.
# It ensures docs-only PRs can merge even when Build & Test (which has paths-ignore) doesn't run.
#
# Branch protection should require: "CI Gate" + "CodeQL"
# Build & Test continues to run only on code changes (via paths-ignore in ci.yml)
