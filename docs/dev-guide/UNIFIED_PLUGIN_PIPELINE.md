# Unified Plugin Pipeline

This document captures the governance model for versioning plugins that consume `Lidarr.Plugin.Common` alongside official Lidarr host binaries. The intent is to keep every plugin aligned to the same host assemblies, the same shared library commit, and the same packaging rules.

This playbook applies to **plugin repositories**. The shared `Lidarr.Plugin.Common` package keeps its own semantic versioning and is not pinned to host assembly versions.

## 1. Single source of truth repository

- Stand up a `plugins-platform` repository.
- Pin the blessed commit of `Lidarr.Plugin.Common` (currently `52ffc434db552aac24c21f72d95c197773523beb`).
- For plugin repositories, store a shared `Directory.Build.props` that sets `<UseHostVersioning>true</UseHostVersioning>`. This pins plugin `AssemblyVersion`/`FileVersion` to the host release (e.g., `10.0.0.35686`) while the shared library keeps semantic versioning.
- Ship `scripts/sync-host-assemblies.ps1` that copies host binaries from your canonical Lidarr build drop into `artifacts/host-assemblies/` and validates `AssemblyVersion` â‡” `FileVersion`.
- Every plugin consumes this repo as a submodule to inherit build props, scripts, and assemblies.

```

git submodule add https://github.com/your-org/plugins-platform.git extern/plugins-platform

```

## 2. Version-gated CI workflow
Each plugin repository must:

1. Update/init the `plugins-platform` submodule.
2. Execute `scripts/sync-host-assemblies.ps1 -Target ../Lidarr/_output/net6.0` (or equivalent path).
3. Run `dotnet build -c Release`.
4. Run `dotnet test -c Release --no-build`.
5. Fail fast if the resulting `Lidarr.Plugin.Common.dll` or host assemblies report anything other than the pinned host versions (e.g., `10.0.0.35686`).

Use GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or similar. Example GitHub Actions steps:

```

- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    submodules: recursive

- name: Sync host assemblies
  shell: pwsh
  run: ./extern/plugins-platform/scripts/sync-host-assemblies.ps1 -Target ../Lidarr/_output/net6.0

- name: Build
  run: dotnet build -c Release -warnaserror:NU1903

- name: Test
  run: dotnet test -c Release --no-build

```

## 3. Automated ILRepack enforcement

- Under `plugins-platform/build/`, define a reusable MSBuild target (for example `EnsureMergedDependencies.targets`).
- Target inspects `@(ResolvedFileToPublish)` after build.
- If any `Lidarr.*` or `Lidarr.Plugin.Common.dll` is present, fail the build with a descriptive message.
- Provide shared props to wire the target into every plugin (`<Import Project="$(PluginsPlatformRoot)/build/EnsureMergedDependencies.targets" />`).

## 4. Coordinated release job

- Create a meta-pipeline that triggers when:
  - `Lidarr.Plugin.Common` version changes, or
  - The target Lidarr host version changes.
- Steps:
  1. Update `plugins-platform` `Directory.Build.props` + host assemblies.
  2. Sequentially trigger each plugin CI (GitHub workflow dispatch, ADO pipeline, etc.).
  3. Collect artifacts.
  4. Run an end-to-end smoke test (e.g., Docker Compose with Lidarr 2.14.2.4786 + all plugins).
  5. Publish a consolidated release bundle and changelog.
- No plugin release is approved until the orchestrated run succeeds.

## 5. Artifact & manifest consistency

- Share `scripts/package-plugin.ps1` that:
  - Regenerates `plugin.json`.
  - Injects dependency metadata (min Lidarr version, `Lidarr.Plugin.Common` commit).
  - Produces hashes.
  - Uploads ZIP + manifest to your internal registry (S3, Azure Storage, etc.).
- CI should call this after tests and fail if metadata is missing or stale.

## 6. Monitoring & alerting

- Schedule a recurring pipeline (daily/weekly) that:
  - Spins up Lidarr 2.14.2.4786 with the most recent plugins.
  - Scrapes logs for assembly load errors ("Could not load...").
  - Sends alerts (Slack/Teams/email) on failure.

## 7. Plugin version bump playbook

1. Update `plugins-platform`:
   - Refresh host assemblies to the new Lidarr version.
   - Update `Directory.Build.props` with the new `AssemblyVersion`/`FileVersion` used by plugins.
   - Tag the commit.
2. Create pull requests in every plugin repo to bump the submodule reference.
3. Ensure CI passes (sync script + ILRepack + build/test).
4. Run the coordinated release job and publish artifacts.
5. Update consumer-facing changelogs or release notes to signal the new host requirement.

Keeping this playbook centralized prevents drift, keeps plugins consistent, and eliminates crash loops caused by mismatched `Lidarr.Plugin.Common` binaries.
